public class Polymorphism {
//Compile time polymorphism/overloading methods/constructor: STATIC POLY
	//Polymorphism in Java performs a single action in different ways; many forms
	//Should be in same class
	//Methods should have same name different parameters
	//change type of parameters
	//or change the number of parameters(Data types: String to string buffer to builder etc)
	
	
//Runtime polymorphism/Overriding: DYNAMIC POLY
	//Overriding happens only with an inheritance
	//Overriding apply to same exact method in super class; 
	//instantiate obj for overridden method in super class should refer to subclass
	//overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of method
